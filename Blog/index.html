                  UGH and now it's like that conversation never happened. <br>
                  bc of course it didn't and of course there's nothing there and i need to <strong>get on with it</strong><br>
              <span class="blog-date">February 3, 2026 • 10:27 PM</span><br><br>
                  i'll still dream about my sunset though of course. because i never learn.

              <strong>today feels quieter than usual</strong><br>
              <span class="blog-date">February 3, 2026 • 10:27 PM</span><br><br>
                i thought today was going to be quiet when I woke up. the days i wake up like that rarely are quiet. first was the find of the star wars vhs tapes and i nearly was full over from that alone.<br>
                i was all settled and quiet and then? howl. <br>
                he needed to talk so i let him, as usual. <br>
                i get nervous that i annoy him when i'm talking, even if i'm just trying to distract him.<br>
                and it's even worse when i try to poke fun at him and think i might've gone too far.<br>
                and then sometimes he looks at me, with his eyebrow raised in the way that always goes straight to the back of my head and mak'es me feel dizzy.<br>
                i think i must be in some danger now of falling completely in love with him now. <br>
                its <strong>insufferable</strong> <br>
                god hes so.. UGGGGG
                he mentioned he's more of an ocean person today, which makes sense, i love staring at the ocean.<br>
                i tried telling my story about the balcony in NC but i don't think it made the impression i wanted it to. <br>
                when he left i tried to say that i could squeeze him harder, which he rebuked <em> immediately</em> by hugging me as hard as he could. <br>
                that went on and on until i wheezed and when he turned around to look at me, no doubt seeing me flustered<br><br>
                i kicked him out of the house *not seriously* shouting to get out of my house and that of course that i hate him.. and anyway.
                he texted asking if i was serious about that last part, which of course i'm not and followed up with far to flowery language i'm sure to regret<br><br>
                and probably hear about later.
